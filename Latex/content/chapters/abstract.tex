\section*{Abstract}

In this thesis we evaluate SHAMPU, a test bed for WSNs developed at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
SHAMPU is a platform, which allows the debugging and reprogramming of an attached sensor node.
Our focus for this evaluation is the wireless communication between SHAMPU nodes, for which the ANT protocol is used. 
We design and run several different experiments in order to determine the capabilities of the ANT-chip used.
