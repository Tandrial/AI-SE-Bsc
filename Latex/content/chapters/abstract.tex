\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis, we evaluate a component of SHAMPU(Single chip Host for Autonomous Mote Programming over USB), developed at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
SHAMPU is a framework which allows the monitoring, debugging, and reprogramming of wireless sensor networks (WSN). 
Our focus for this evaluation is on the wireless communication between SHAMPU nodes, for which the ANT protocol is used. 
We designed and ran several different experiments in order to determine the capabilities of the ANT-chip in use.
