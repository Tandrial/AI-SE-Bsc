\section*{Abstract}
In this thesis we evaluate a component of SHAMPU(Single chip Host for Autonomous Mote Programming over USB), developed at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
SHAMPU is a framework which allows the monitoring, debugging and reprogramming of wireless sensor network (WSN). 
Our focus for this evaluation is the wireless communication between the SHAMPU nodes themselves, for which the ANT protocol is used. 
We design and run several different experiments in order to determine the capabilities of the ANT-chip in use.
