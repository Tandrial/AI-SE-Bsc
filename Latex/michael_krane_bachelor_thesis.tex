% We recommend to split your document into several files. Usually one for every chapter is a

% see two paragraphs below) you will be able to single out chapters via the \includeonly{}
% command. Using this mechanism page numbering and references of the full run before will be
% preserved. This also nice, if your latex run tends to get slow and you need to fine tune 
% some formatting in one chapter - just include that one. The rest (or at least the ones before
% the one currently under construction) will remain untouched. This means a boost in compilation time.

%Bibliography
% We strongly recommend to use bibtex to manage your bibliography. It helps you
% structure your references and helps avoiding missing important data for a correct
% quotation. If you have no other idea jabref (http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)
% might be a good idea (Jave runtime environment needed).
% This style is good to use in german master thesis'. You need to have activated
% \usepackage{bigerm} above.
% For english documents just use apalike.
\bibliographystyle{geralpha}


% to finally announce where your bibliography is stored use
% \bibliography{content/references/references}
% it is also possible to have several files separated by comma.
