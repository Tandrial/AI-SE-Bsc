Programmieren in C/C++ Exercise 05 - Michael Krane

3)
	After subtracting the time it takes to create a new Stack each iteration 
	for the move assignment operator the programs prints the following times:

		Copying 10,000,000 stacks took = 0.646s
		Moving  10,000,000 stacks took = 0.093s

	So using move instead of copy is roughly 6 times faster.
