Programmieren in C/C++ Exercise 06 - Michael Krane

1)
	Comparison operators are no necessary to implement, because MyTime can be converted to int. That means that C++ implicitly converts the two MyTime-objects being compared into ints and then does the comparison.

2)
	With pre-increments and decrement you get a reference to the object back. That allows for correct operator chaining, e. g.  *(++(++sArray)). *((sArray++)++) prints the same result, but the value of the sArray object is not increased twice, since the second ++ is applied to a copy of the original object.
