Programmieren in C/C++ Exercise 10 - Michael Krane

1)	After insert() and printnext3() this is the result:
	
	30 32 34  // <-- Vector
	31 32 34  // <-- Deque
	30 31 32  // <-- List

	The expected result is:
	30 31 32  // <-- Vector
	30 31 32  // <-- Deque
	30 31 32  // <-- List

	The reason for this is, that for some STL-Container iterators become invalid after insertion.
	According to the C++-Standard this is the case for vector (see 23.3.6.5)	and deque(see 23.3.3.4) but not for the list (see 23.3.5.4).
	The fix is that iterators should not be reused after insertion, in this specific example we can use the iterator that insert() returns.
