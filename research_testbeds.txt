WSN testbeds

Sensei-UU: nomadic sensor testbed  WiFi

nomadic testbed easly reused for different topologies, without changes to the testing infrastructur

Fixed infrasturctur
Problems:
 cabling major costfactor (example TWIST, MoteLab), also not very useful for testing in the target environment

Goal: Detach WSN testbeds from the infrastructure
How? Architecture for wireless ad hoc infrastructure (easy setup + config)
	 Mobile testbeds nodes with repeatable movements i. e. robots

	 Nodes are connected to sensor hosts (WLAN access points / USB ports /Bluetooth)
	 sensor hosts are connected to a site manager which (wireless backbone)


Choice of communication methode

Bluetooth  : piconets with 7 slaves 1 master (+ 255 parked nodes), modules can be part of multiple piconets, but radio only can 	communicate in one net at a time  
Communication only  ever slave <-> master never slave <-> slave   (roles are switchable)

	==> communication and configuration overhead !!!

BT nodes

	key difference between nodes is the radio component
		bluetooth are not broadcast , must establish channel before communication

	added second radio  (i) 2x slave, (ii) 2x master, (iii) 1x slave 1x master
	difficult ==> solution: each node configured beforehand

	result: Tree structur ==> huge network distance since only one node is connected to the outside world


Smart-Its
	Goal: add smartness to exsisting devices. Sharing info needs communication betweens devices. No central authority ==> ad hoch communication needed, also needs to be robust, scaleable and low power consumption ==> Bluetooth
